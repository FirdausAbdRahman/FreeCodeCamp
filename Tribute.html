          <h3>Here's a time line of Marie Curie's life:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1867</strong> - Born in Warsaw, Poland</li>
            <li><strong>1891</strong> - went to Paris for higher studies in math, physics and chemistry.</li>
            <li><strong>1895</strong> - Marie married Pierre Curie.</li>
            <li><strong>1903</strong> - Won a Nobel Prize for discovering a new element.</li>        
            <li><strong>1906</strong> - Marie's husband had a tragic death.</li>        
            <li><strong>1911</strong> - Won a 2nd Noble Prize for radioactivity.</li>      
            <li><strong>1934</strong> - Died from an illness</li>        
                  
          </ul>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"The result of the Curies' work was epoch-making. Radium's radioactivity was so great that it could not be ignored. It seemed to contradict the principle of the conservation of energy and therefore forced a reconsideration of the foundations of physics. On the experimental level the discovery of radium provided men like Ernest Rutherford with sources of radioactivity with which they could probe the structure of the atom. As a result of Rutherford's experiments with alpha radiation, the nuclear atom was first postulated. In medicine, the radioactivity of radium appeared to offer a means by which cancer could be successfully attacked"</p>
